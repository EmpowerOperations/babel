//! Babel's abstract syntax tree.
//!
//! ANTLR 4 produces a *parse* tree and offers no way to rewrite it — the tree
//! rewriting that ANTLR 3 supported was deliberately removed, and Parr's
//! recommendation for v4 is to build your own model with a visitor. This module
//! is that model. Everything downstream of [`crate::frontend::parse`] works here, not on
//! ANTLR contexts.
//!
//! Two invariants shape the design:
//!
//! 1. **Symbols are resolved during lowering**, not at evaluation time. Names
//!    become [`GlobalId`] or [`LocalSlot`], so shadowing (`sum(1,3,x1 -> x1) + x1`)
//!    is settled structurally and evaluation needs no scope chain.
//! 2. **Every node carries a [`Span`]**, because diagnostics are reported against
//!    arbitrary sub-expressions at both compile time and run time.
