//!
//! Each pass is `fn(Program) -> Program`, taking ownership. Passing trees by
//! value means unchanged subtrees are *moved* rather than cloned or refcounted,
//! which is why the AST needs no persistent collections to be effectively
//! immutable.
//!
//! # The boolean convention
//!
//! Babel has no boolean values at run time. A comparison lowers to arithmetic
//! whose *sign* carries the truth value: `<= 0` is true, `> 0` is false. That is
//! the canonical `g(x) <= 0` constraint form, so a violated constraint reports
//! how badly it was violated rather than merely that it was.
