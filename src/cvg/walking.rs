//! Hit-and-run: walk the chord of the feasible region through the current point.
//!
//! From a feasible point, pick a direction uniformly on the unit sphere, take the
//! line through the point in that direction, and jump to a uniformly chosen
//! feasible place on it. Repeat. Needs no solver — it is arithmetic over
//! `evaluate` — but it needs a feasible point to start from.
//!
//! # Why this and not the JVM walker
//!
//! `RandomBoundedWalkingImproverPool` took a *half*-ray from a fixed base and
//! placed the result at `base + offset * nextDouble()` — uniform in radius.
//! Volume in `d` dimensions grows as `r^(d-1)`, so uniform-in-radius piles
//! points around the base and leaves the boundary empty. In 200 dimensions
//! essentially all the volume is near the boundary, so that is the whole region
//! missed.
//!
//! Hit-and-run (Smith, 1984) fixes it by construction rather than by correction:
//! take the chord both ways, sample uniformly along it, and make the result the
//! next state. The chain converges to the uniform distribution over the region.
//!
//! # Finding the chord: shrinkage, not bisection
//!
//! The obvious way to find where the region ends along the ray is to bisect
//! inward from the box wall. It is wrong, and instructively so. Binary search
//! finds the *first* boundary only when the predicate is monotone, and
//! feasibility along a line is not: for `(x+2)(x-1) == 0 +/- 1` the region is
//! two bands, and a ray from x = -2 toward the wall at x = 5 passes through the
//! gap and back into the far band, so the search brackets a chord spanning both.
//! Points sampled on it land in the gap, the move is refused, and the chain sits
//! still emitting the same point.
//!
//! Neal's shrinkage procedure (slice sampling, 2003) is the fix, and is cheaper
//! than what it replaces. Start with the whole box chord, sample on it, and if
//! the draw is infeasible shrink that side of the interval *to the draw* and try
//! again. It needs no monotonicity, converges geometrically onto the feasible
//! piece holding the current point, costs one feasibility test per attempt
//! rather than two brackets' worth, and leaves the uniform distribution
//! invariant.
//!
//! # Two kinds of move
//!
//! Pure hit-and-run mixes slowly in high dimensions, and measurably so: in the
//! 200-variable benchmark a move travels about 0.035 through a region 7.07
//! across, because the chord is cut short by the nearest of two hundred walls.
//! That is a random walk needing roughly `(7.07/0.035)^2` — about 40,000 —
//! moves per independent sample, which is the textbook `O(d^2)` and not
//! something a constant factor fixes.
//!
//! So half the moves step along a coordinate axis instead, sweeping the
//! coordinates in order. On a region whose bounds are axis-aligned an axis move
//! resamples that coordinate across its whole feasible range, so one sweep
//! produces an independent point and mixing becomes `O(d)`. Axis moves are
//! useless on a region angled across the coordinates — a diagonal ribbon leaves
//! nowhere to go — which is exactly where the random directions carry the
//! chain, so the two cover each other.
//!
//! Mixing them is sound: both kernels leave the uniform distribution invariant
//! (an axis move is Gibbs on that coordinate), and a random choice between
//! kernels sharing a stationary distribution preserves it.
//!
//! It also means a chain is not confined to its starting component: a first draw
//! landing in another piece is feasible, so it is taken. The proposal is
//! symmetric — the box chord is the same segment from either end — so this is a
//! legitimate move rather than a leak. Crossing still needs both pieces to share
//! a line, which is rare enough that a seed in each remains worth having.
//!
//! # Preconditioning: directions drawn from the region's own shape
//!
//! Random directions on the sphere are the right answer for a round region and
//! the wrong one for a tube. P118's polytope couples its variables in chains
//! of ±7 bands, so it is long along a few diagonals and thin across every
//! other direction; a uniformly random direction almost always points at a
//! nearby wall, chords are short, and the chain crawls along the tube. Measured:
//! at two moves per dimension between emissions it fails its two-run agreement
//! on four seeds in ten, and at twenty it passes all ten. The walker converges;
//! it emits ten times too often for that shape. Raising the thinning for every
//! problem would multiply the cost of the 200-dimensional cases, which are round
//! and mix fine as they are.
//!
//! So the random half of the moves is drawn from the shape of the region as the
//! chains learnt it during burn-in: a standard normal draw is multiplied by the
//! Cholesky factor of the states' covariance and normalised, which makes a
//! direction along the tube's long axis as likely as the tube is long. Axis
//! moves are untouched — on an axis-aligned box they are exact Gibbs steps and
//! rotating them would only hurt.
//!
//! **This is a change of coordinates, not a bias.** Hit-and-run with any
//! direction distribution that is symmetric (`d` and `-d` equally likely) and
//! reaches every direction leaves the uniform distribution invariant (Bélisle,
//! Romeijn and Smith, 1993); the shape only decides how fast the chain mixes.
//! A badly estimated shape therefore costs speed and never correctness, which is
//! what makes it safe to estimate from a burn-in that has not itself mixed.
//!
//! **The estimate is frozen before anything is emitted.** Refitting as the run
//! proceeds would make the chain non-Markovian and void the argument above. It
//! is fitted from the second half of every chain's burn-in, refined by a second
//! burn-in walked under it — chains that crawled on the sphere never traversed
//! the tube, so the first fit under-reads its length, and on P118 the first fit
//! alone left one seed in ten marginally red — and then kept for the walker's
//! life.
//!
//! **The estimate is shrunk toward its diagonal by `m / n`.** Burn-in states
//! are heavily autocorrelated — a coordinate is only refreshed by its own axis
//! move, every `2d` steps — so a 200-dimensional covariance is estimated from
//! a few dozen effective samples and its spectrum is mostly sampling noise: on a
//! round box that noise would *introduce* anisotropy where the truth has none.
//! `m / n`, dimensions over samples, is the ratio that governs that spread, and
//! blending toward the diagonal with that weight bounds the noise's condition
//! number at about four for any ratio below one and collapses to the diagonal
//! at one or more. In 200 dimensions that is the diagonal, which is harmless
//! on a round box; on P118, with fifteen dimensions and a few hundred samples,
//! it is nearly the full covariance, and the tube's axis is a large eigenvalue
//! that a few dozen samples already resolve.
//!
//! The fit is deterministic per seed on one machine. Across machines `faer`'s
//! matrix product may sum in a different order, so the factor can differ in
//! the last place and the emitted points with it; nothing depends on the same
//! seed reproducing across machines.
