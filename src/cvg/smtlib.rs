//! Rendering constraints as an SMT-LIB2 document.
//!
//! A pure `&[Ast] -> String`, with no solver attached and none required
//! to test it. That separation is the whole reason for emitting text rather than
//! building a solver's AST: the JVM version transcoded straight into Z3 objects,
//! so the only way to see what it had asked was to ask Z3.
//!
//! # What gets asserted
//!
//! Every constraint asserts as a boolean term — `(assert (> |x| 4.0))` — named
//! `cN` so an unsat core points back at the constraint the author wrote. Side
//! conditions the term depends on, described below, are asserted alongside it.
//!
//! # A comparison is emitted as a comparison
//!
//! It did not used to be. `rewrite_booleans` ran in the shared pipeline and
//! flattened every constraint into a residual before this module saw it, so
//! `x > 4` arrived as `4 - x + EPSILON` — the strictness carried by a nudge that
//! only works *because of `f64` rounding*. Real arithmetic does not round, so
//! emitting it literally put a three-hundred-digit denormal in the document and
//! still meant the wrong thing; this module had to recognise the marker and undo
//! it.
//!
//! `Kind::Compare` and `Kind::NearEq` survive compilation now and each backend
//! lowers them itself. `x > 4` is `(> |x| 4.0)`, and `a == b +/- t` is two
//! bounds `and`-ed rather than `(<= (expr_max …) 0.0)` — an `ite` where a
//! conjunction was meant. Both are easier for a solver and for a reader.
//!
//! # Side conditions
//!
//! Some operations need more than a term. `(/ a b)` needs `b` pinned away from
//! zero, because SMT-LIB leaves division by zero *underspecified* — the solver
//! is free to choose whatever value for it satisfies the constraint, and it
//! does: the first document this emitter handed Z3 came back solved with every
//! variable zero, satisfying `x2 == x1 + x2/2 - x3/x4` through `0/0`. Babel
//! evaluates that point to NaN and rejects it, so the solver's answer would have
//! been binned and the search would have spun. With the guard, the same document
//! yields a real point.
//!
//! `sqrt` and `cbrt` need an auxiliary variable: there is no `sqrt` in QF_NRA,
//! but `y >= 0 and y*y = x` says the same thing, and a solver handles it
//! comfortably.
//!
//! Both need the translator to contribute *commands* alongside its term, which
//! is why the walk carries an accumulator rather than being a pure
//! `Expr -> Sexp`.
//!
//! # Syntax lives in the templates
//!
//! Nothing here writes a parenthesis, a keyword or an operator's SMT-LIB
//! name. The walk below decides *what* to say — which helper, which guard,
//! which auxiliary, what could not be said — and hands each node's already
//! rendered children to a [`Term`], whose askama template under
//! `templates/smt2/` spells it. A template arm closes what it opens, so a
//! term is balanced by construction; the document template owns every
//! newline, so a `;` comment cannot eat the command after it. Both matter
//! more than they sound: `Solver::from_string` reports a syntax error by
//! silently accepting nothing and then answering `sat`, and a comment missing
//! its newline loses one command quietly. `Z3Backend::solve` refuses a
//! document that produced no assertions, `smt::tests` put every document the
//! emitter can build through Z3's parser, and `every_document_is_balanced`
//! below counts the parentheses; those are the nets now that balance is a
//! property of five small templates rather than of a type.
//!
//! This replaced an `Sexp` value type with `sexp!`/`define_fun!` macros on
//! 2026-09-05. Crates exist that would do the s-expression layer — `smtlib`
//! and `aws-smt-ir` are permissively licensed, `smtlib-syntax` is closest in
//! intent but GPL-3.0, which rules it out for a library that gets linked and
//! shipped — and Z3's typed AST would skip text altogether at the price of
//! welding the emitter to one solver and giving up a document you can read,
//! diff and hand to something else. None of them touch the part that is
//! actually hard, which is the domain logic in this file.
//!
//! # What cannot be emitted, and why that is reported rather than dropped
//!
//! This targets `QF_NIRA`: the field operations, comparison, `ite`, `let`, and
//! `to_int`/`to_real`. Anything outside that — the transcendentals, `log`, a
//! power with a non-integer exponent — is *reported* through
//! [`Document::untranslated`].
//!
//! The JVM version dropped such constraints silently, and its own fixture pinned
//! the consequence: `sin of value offset by multiples of pi` asserted that the
//! returned points included ones which **did not satisfy the constraints**. A
//! solver answering a question you quietly did not ask is worse than a solver
//! that says it cannot help.
//!
//! The list is shorter than it was, because some of those gaps were dialect
//! rather than theory. `floor`, `ceil` and `%` used to be on it and are not: the
//! first two are `to_int` and the third is `a - b*trunc(a/b)`, and the only
//! price is the wider logic. What is left is genuinely missing rather than
//! merely unwritten — Z3 has no logarithm under any spelling, and its `sin`
//! parses and then answers `unknown`. dReal has all of them as primitives, at
//! the cost of a subprocess on a customer's machine.
//!
//! # Fidelity
//!
//! Literals are emitted as shortest round-trip decimals, which is *not* exact:
//! SMT-LIB reals are exact decimals, so `0.1` there means one tenth, while the
//! `f64` spelled `0.1` is 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827.
//!
//! Emitting exact dyadic rationals instead would close that particular gap and
//! is a one-function change — but it would not make the model exact, because the
//! far larger gap is that SMT reasons in *real arithmetic* while babel evaluates
//! in `f64`. Every operation rounds; `x^3` as `(* x x x)` need not equal
//! `x.powf(3.0)` in the last place. The model is a real-arithmetic idealisation
//! of the computation, deliberately — and a solver's points are filtered through
//! babel's own `evaluate` before anybody sees them. Exact literals would be false
//! precision about everything else.
