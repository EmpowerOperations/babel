//! Constrained random vector generation.
//!
//! Given a box of input variables and a set of babel constraints, produce
//! points that satisfy all of them and that cover the feasible region
//! reasonably evenly.
//!
//! Lives inside babel rather than alongside it so that [`crate::ast`] can stay
//! private — the SMT-LIB2 emitter is an internal function over the AST, not a
//! published consumer of it.
//!
//! # Strategy
//!
//! Finding the *first* feasible point is the hard part, and for a tight region
//! it needs a solver. Once there, cheap strategies cover the space quickly. That
//! is why `ConstraintSolver::solve` is the expensive, awaitable call and
//! `FeasibleSamples::take` is not.
//!
//! This module is the engine. The types a caller holds — the system, the
//! solver, the samples handle, the verdicts — are defined at the crate root
//! (`system.rs`, `solve.rs`, `repair.rs`) and this is what they drive.
//!
//! The strategies divide along that line:
//!
//! * **Uniform rejection sampling** — the brute squad — *probes*, and on a
//!   region it reaches often enough it simply delivers: unbiased by
//!   construction, no burn-in, no chain. Where the probe lands nothing and the
//!   solver could not settle it, the same sampler keeps proposing on every
//!   core, for a proposal budget, until one batch lands: a region a millionth
//!   or a hundred-millionth of its box is a matter of milliseconds to seconds,
//!   and the seed it finds is what the walker starts from.
//! * **Hit-and-run** *emits* everywhere the probe did not settle it. It
//!   converges to the uniform distribution over the region, so what a caller
//!   receives is governed by the strategy with a guarantee. It cannot start
//!   without a feasible point, and a seed comes from the probe's own hits,
//!   from the solver, or from brute force.
//!
//! Neither can reach a region of measure zero — an equality constraint with a
//! tolerance tight enough is a ribbon that sampling will not land on and a walk
//! cannot be started in. That is the solver's job, and it goes *before* brute
//! force: when the probe comes back empty *and* [`Strategy::Solver`] is in
//! the list, Z3 is asked for a seed. It settles a ribbon or a contradiction
//! in milliseconds where brute force would spend its whole budget, and only
//! it can return [`Infeasibility::Proved`]. What it answers `unknown` on —
//! anything transcendental — is exactly what brute force then spends the
//! budget on. Without a solver in the list the probe hands straight to brute
//! force, and an empty search is simply [`Infeasibility::NotFound`].
