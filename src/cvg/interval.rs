//! Interval arithmetic, and what an expression evaluates to over a box.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! The walker's central question is *conditional*: with every other coordinate
//! held where it is, what values may this one take? Answering it needs an
//! expression evaluated over a set rather than a point, which is what this is.
//!
//! # The only invariant that matters
//!
//! **Every interval here is a superset of the values it models.** Not a tight
//! enclosure, a superset.
//!
//! That asymmetry is the whole design. A proposal drawn from a superset and then
//! judged by `ConstraintSystem::is_feasible` is, conditioned on acceptance, distributed
//! exactly as one drawn from the true set: uniform on `S`, restricted to
//! `T` inside `S`, is uniform on `T`. So an interval that is too wide costs a
//! rejected proposal and nothing else, while one that is too narrow removes
//! reachable points and biases the answer silently.
//!
//! Everything follows from that. Anything unknown answers [`Interval::ENTIRE`],
//! which is why this is total and has no error type: "I cannot narrow this"
//! degrades to the behaviour the walker already had.
//!
//! # Why this is not `inari`
//!
//! IEEE 1788 libraries buy *tightness together with* soundness, at the cost of
//! rounding-mode control and a dependency in a crate Artemis links. We need only
//! the soundness, and a padding of a few ulps outward buys it outright — see
//! [`Interval::rounded`] for how much padding each class of operator earns.
