//! Handing constraints to an SMT solver.
//!
//! The document itself is [`super::smtlib`]'s job; this is what sends it and reads
//! the answer back.
//!
//! # Why a document rather than a solver's API
//!
//! The JVM version built Z3 AST objects directly and paid for it: a hand-rolled
//! Taylor expansion of `sin` out to 1/11!, definitional axioms for `sqrt`,
//! `cbrt`, `log`, `ln`, `floor` and `ceil`, four axioms for `mod`, and a
//! mechanism that silently *dropped* any constraint making the solver answer
//! UNKNOWN. Roughly a third of that file was fighting the API rather than
//! solving constraints — and because it transcoded straight into Z3 objects, the
//! only way to see what it had asked was to ask Z3.
//!
//! Text is readable, diffable, testable with no solver attached, and portable
//! across solvers. It also makes the backend a small thing rather than the whole
//! integration.
//!
//! # The one hazard worth knowing
//!
//! **`Solver::from_string` returns `()`.** It cannot report a syntax error, and
//! a malformed document leaves an empty solver that then answers `sat` instantly
//! with an empty model — so an emitter bug reads as "solved it". Every verdict
//! here is therefore gated on the assertions actually having arrived. A parse
//! error loses the *whole* document rather than the tail after it, which is what
//! makes that single check sufficient; there is a test pinning exactly that, so
//! it will say so if Z3 ever becomes more forgiving.
//!
//! # The other hazard: Z3 does not always stop
//!
//! `rlimit` makes a hard instance give up deterministically, and usually it
//! does. But `(^ x 1.234)` — a rational exponent, which the emitter refuses
//! precisely because of this — ran `check()` for 119 seconds against a
//! 5-second `timeout` and an rlimit of a hundred thousand, and a first attempt
//! for eight minutes before it was killed. Both budgets are one cancel flag
//! that Z3's loops are supposed to poll, and some loop does not. Where one such
//! hole was found there will be others, so every call goes through
//! [`Z3Backend::solve`]'s leash: Z3 runs on its own thread, is interrupted when
//! the caller cancels or a wall-clock ceiling passes, and is abandoned with an
//! error-level log line if it ignores that. The caller then carries on without
//! it, which is the failure mode a hung process never offers.
