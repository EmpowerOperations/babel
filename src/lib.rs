//! Sojourn — constrained random vector generation over a small expression language, babel.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let compiled = sojourn::compile("x1 + x2 > 20 - x3^2", &["x1", "x2", "x3"])?;
//!
//! // One column per sample, one row per variable, in the order given.
//! let residuals = compiled.eval(samples.as_ref())?;
//! ```
//!
//! Source text goes in; nothing hands back a syntax tree. Two consumers parse
//! it: the evaluator, which [`compile`]s an expression against a list of
//! variable names and runs it over a batch, and the constrained vector
//! generator, which reads the structure of a set of constraints to search for
//! points that satisfy them — a [`ConstraintSystem`] solved by a
//! [`ConstraintSolver`] into [`FeasibleSamples`], with [`repair`] for a point
//! that is not one of them.
//! `src/README.md` has the picture.
//!
//! Boolean expressions evaluate to a scalar whose *sign* carries the truth
//! value: `<= 0` is true, `> 0` is false. That is the canonical `g(x) <= 0`
//! constraint form, so a violated constraint reports how badly it was violated.

// Crate-private while the shape is still settling; goes public when the
// pluggable rewriter needs it.
