//! A box and the constraints over it, compiled once and asked everything.
//!
//! The system is the compiled thing. Construction proves every constraint
//! binds by compiling it, and keeps the tape; it reads the equalities for
//! which coordinates are driven; it builds the incidence graph between
//! constraints and coordinates. Every point-level question a strategy asks —
//! is this point feasible, what interval may this coordinate take, put the
//! driven coordinates back on their surface — is answered here. The one thing
//! a solver call needs beyond the system, the SMT-LIB logic, travels with the
//! engine's ladder rather than being folded into the system. That is also what
//! lets [`repair`](crate::repair) be a plain function over a
//! `&ConstraintSystem`: nothing is compiled per call.
//!
//! The vocabulary lives here too: a [`Point`] in the box, an [`InputVariable`]
//! bounding one coordinate of it, and a [`ConstraintRef`] naming one
//! constraint the way a caller reads it.
//!
//! Immutable once built. Strategies borrow it; nothing about it is decided at
//! run time.
