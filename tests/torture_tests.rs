//! Constraints built to defeat the solver, so the pool has to survive without it.
//!
//! A real literal exponent is the one power shape every backend refuses to turn
//! into multiplication and every solver refuses outright: `x^1.234` is
//! `exp(1.234 * ln x)`, Z3 has no `exp`, and handing Z3 its own `^` is worse
//! than a refusal — it runs minutes past its rlimit on exactly this exponent
//! (`docs/todo.md`, "Z3 holes"). So the emitter leaves the constraint out of
//! the document, the relaxed document is satisfiable trivially, its witness
//! fails the real constraint, and the pool retreats to sampling: `powf` on
//! every CPU lane and `pow` on the GPU when the sieve is compiled in, both of
//! them bound by the special-function hardware rather than by arithmetic.
//!
//! The contract these pin: sampling finds what is there to be found, and what
//! it cannot find is reported as *not found* — never as proved empty, since
//! nothing could prove it — with the sentence a caller can act on.
