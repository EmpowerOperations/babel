//! The torture problems, ported from `Benchmarks.kt` / `BenchmarksTests.kt`.
//!
//! Where `cvg_pools` is a smoke test, these are the hard ones.
//! `TopCorner200D`'s feasible region is 0.5^200 of its box — about one part in
//! 10^60 — so no amount of rejection sampling will land in it. P118 is
//! Hock-Schittkowski 118: fifteen variables under twenty-nine coupled linear
//! inequalities, and just as hopeless to sample blind.
//!
//! Every problem asserts three things: all points feasible, the requested count
//! delivered, and no duplicates. The JVM harness asserted only the weaker
//! "non-empty", and passed `allowEmptyResults` on the problems that returned
//! nothing at all — which turned two total failures and two 99%-shortfalls into
//! green ticks. That flag is deliberately not ported.
//!
//! # Fairness
//!
//! The JVM `ConstraintSet` carried an expected `centroid` and `dispersion`, and
//! the assertions against them were commented out — with a `TODO` on
//! `TopCorner200D` reading "this value doesnt seem correct at all". Distribution
//! quality, the whole point of a constrained vector generator, was never
//! actually under test.
//!
//! Brought back here, computed rather than guessed. `dispersion` was not wrong,
//! incidentally — 0.25 is the mean absolute deviation of a uniform on [0,1] — it
//! simply is not a statistic with a critical value attached, so there was no
//! threshold to compare it against. Everything below has one.
//!
//! The leverage is that **rejection sampling over the declared box is uniform
//! over the feasible region by construction** — that is what rejection sampling
//! *is* — so it does not need measuring against a standard, it can serve as one.
//! Note "over the declared box": a sampler that narrowed its proposals toward
//! what it had found would exclude a part of the region it had not seen, which
//! is why the oracle is [`Strategy::BruteSquad`] specifically, and why the
//! adaptive variant that once existed was never the oracle.
//!
//! That gives four oracles, each valid somewhere different — see [`Oracle`].
