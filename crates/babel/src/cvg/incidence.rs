//! Which constraints name which coordinates, both ways round.
//!
//! A constraint system is a bipartite graph: constraints on one side,
//! coordinates on the other, an edge wherever a constraint names a coordinate.
//! The walker needs it traversed in both directions — given a coordinate, which
//! constraints have anything to say about it, and given a constraint, which row
//! of a point each of its symbols reads — so both are stored.
//!
//! # Why the indices are newtypes
//!
//! Both directions are lists of `usize`, and they mean **different things**:
//! a value in one is a position in the schema, a value in the other is a
//! position in the constraint list. Written as bare integers the transpose
//! reads the same whichever way round it is built —
//! `naming[row].push(constraint)` and `naming[constraint].push(row)` both
//! compile, and only one is right. [`Row`] and [`ConstraintId`] make the
//! compiler read it instead.
//!
//! # On cycles
//!
//! This graph may certainly contain them: `c0 - x1 - c1 - x2 - c0` is two
//! constraints sharing two variables, which is ordinary. The graph where a
//! cycle *means* something is the dependency graph `classify::plan` derives
//! from a set of drives, and it is refused there.
