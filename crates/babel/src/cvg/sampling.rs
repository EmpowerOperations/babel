//! Rejection sampling over the input box: the brute squad.
//!
//! Cheap and unbiased, and it works whenever the feasible region is a decent
//! fraction of the box — or, given enough proposals, a small one. It cannot
//! find a measure-zero region: an equality constraint like
//! `x1 == sqrt(x2) +/- 0.0001` is a ribbon that uniform sampling will
//! essentially never land on. That is what the solver is for.
//!
//! Candidates are proposed as a matrix, one column each, filled in bulk from
//! a Xoshiro256++ stream: nine integer operations per draw where the ChaCha
//! stream it replaced spent a block cipher round, and no allocation per
//! candidate where there used to be one `Vec` each. The pool judges the whole
//! matrix with the batched evaluator, which is what made the fill the
//! bottleneck in the first place.
//!
//! When the pool's probe lands nothing, [`RandomSampler::search_for_seed`]
//! keeps proposing on every core until a batch lands or a proposal budget is
//! spent. Batches are numbered and each is a pure function of its number, so
//! the point that comes out does not depend on how many threads looked for it.
