//! The equality taxonomy, measured rather than assumed.
//!
//! Babel admits exactly one equality form — `a == b +/- t`, with `t` a literal —
//! and that one syntax covers at least six structurally different problems. The
//! taxonomy is written up in the root `todo.md` under *Equality constraints*;
//! these are the cases that decide whether it is real.
//!
//! **These are expected to be red, and the red is the deliverable.** The pool
//! today treats every equality identically: one residual, no idea that a
//! variable is pinned, driven, or one of two branches. The classifier that would
//! tell those apart is being designed against what these measure, so a case that
//! fails here is a specification for it, not a regression.
//!
//! # Why these and not the existing pool cases
//!
//! [`cvg_pools`](../cvg_pools.rs) already carries one case per taxonomy row and
//! every one of them is green. That is not evidence the shapes are handled — the
//! tolerances there are loose enough (`1e-3` to `1e-5`) that the band has volume
//! a walker can move in, so the pipeline never has to know what kind of equality
//! it is looking at. Tighten the tolerance and the distinction starts to matter.
//! Each case here is a pool case with the slack taken out, which is the cheapest
//! honest way to find the floor.
//!
//! **Rows A and B are green as of the classifier** ([`cvg::classify`]) — a
//! variable alone on one side of an equality is computed from the others rather
//! than searched for, which is what lets a walker move along a measure-zero
//! surface instead of jittering beside it. Rows C, D and E classify as `Opaque`
//! and are still red, which is the whole point of keeping them here.
//!
//! Case F — implicit, `sin(x) == x/2` — is deliberately absent. No use case has
//! turned up for `x == f(x)`, and Newton is a lot of machinery to carry for a
//! shape nobody writes. The classifier should recognise it as a self-dependency
//! and refuse it; see `todo.md`.
//!
//! # What is asserted
//!
//! Three claims, and the third is the one that bites. Delivering the requested
//! count and having every point feasible are what the pool fixtures already
//! check. **Coverage** is new: a solver hands back one witness, and a pool that
//! reports that witness five hundred times has satisfied both of the other two
//! claims while exploring nothing. So each case names the coordinates that are
//! genuinely free and the fraction of their range the sample must span.
