//! The brute squad's own tests: does the pool find a first feasible point in
//! the regime where it must *sample harder*, and how many candidates a second
//! can it judge while trying?
//!
//! `i-am-the-brute-squad.md` at the repo root is the plan this file is step 0
//! of. The regime is a feasible fraction of about 1e-6 to 1e-9, where the SMT
//! solver cannot help — usually because the constraint holds a transcendental,
//! which Z3 answers `unknown` on — and the honest answer is wide-batch sampling
//! on every core and any GPU present. These tests are red until that exists,
//! and go green a rung at a time as each tier lands.
//!
//! # Two fixtures
//!
//! **Time to first hit** is empirical: did a point arrive inside the budget or
//! not. It goes through the public [`ConstraintSolver::solve`] path, because
//! the tier being built lives inside it, and it keeps the solver *out* by
//! passing [`SAMPLING_ONLY`] — Z3 answers `x1 > 0.999999` instantly and would
//! turn every rung into a measurement of Z3.
//!
//! **Checks per second** is the engineering dial: uniform candidates filled
//! straight into a matrix, every constraint of a family evaluated over the
//! batch, and the columns that pass counted. Two rates, `eval-only` against
//! `pipeline`, separate the evaluator from the random-number generation that
//! has to feed it. Recorded into `performance-records/` like the evaluator
//! ledgers, with the same caveats.
//!
//! # The families
//!
//! Three shapes over the unit cube, each with an analytically exact feasible
//! fraction `p`, so a test named `1e6` really is a one-in-a-million region:
//!
//! | family | why `p` is exact |
//! |---|---|
//! | corner: `x_i > 1 - q`, `q = p^(1/3)` | the box `(1-q, 1]^3` has volume `q^3` |
//! | ball: `x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 < r^2`, `r = (6p/π)^(1/3)` | one octant of a ball is `π r^3 / 6` |
//! | sine corner: `sin(x_i) > sin(1 - q)` | `sin` is increasing on `[0, 1]`, so this is the corner again |
//!
//! The sine corner is the one the tier exists for: the same region as the
//! corner, but written so that no solver can be asked about it. The ball is
//! there because a corner is axis-aligned, which is the easy shape for anything
//! that boxes in a region once it has a point; a sphere is not.
//!
//! # Time to first hit is geometric
//!
//! With hit rate `p` the expected number of proposals before the first hit is
//! `1/p`, and the tail is heavy: a quarter of runs need 1.4x the expectation,
//! one in twenty needs 3x. So a single attempt against a budget is a coin with
//! a known bias, and this file runs up to three: **pass on two hits, fail on
//! two misses.** With `m = exp(-budget / expected)` the chance a green rung
//! fails is `3m² - 2m³` — 4.9% at a budget of twice the expectation, 0.7% at
//! three times, 0.013% at five. The rule for the tiers that follow: a rung is
//! *green* only once its expected first-hit time is at most a third of the
//! budget, and anything closer than that is not a reading.
//!
//! The 1e-4 rungs used to be a coin: with the pool giving up after its
//! 10,000-candidate probe, a seeded run either landed in that probe or it did
//! not, and two of three seeds did not. Step 4's loop is what made them a
//! reading — the second batch lands what the first missed.
//!
//! # What "red" looks like
//!
//! Since step 4 the pool keeps sampling after an empty probe, on every core,
//! until a batch lands or a billion candidates have been judged
//! ([`DEFAULT_PROPOSAL_BUDGET`](babel::cvg::DEFAULT_PROPOSAL_BUDGET)). A rung
//! beyond that reach — 1e-10 and below — spends the budget and reports
//! `gave up` after three to seven seconds on this laptop's sixteen threads,
//! depending on how heavy the constraints are; a rung whose wall budget is
//! shorter than that reports `timed out` instead. Before
//! step 4 every rung below 1e-4 failed in milliseconds. The rung comments
//! below say which tier each one was green from.
//!
//! # The budget, and what dropping the future does
//!
//! [`solve`] runs the search on a worker thread and its future waits on a
//! oneshot for the opening verdict. The budget here is enforced by polling
//! the future by hand with a no-op waker and **dropping it** when time is up.
//! Dropping the receiver is the cancellation signal: the brute-force search
//! polls for it between batches and stops, so the worker is gone within a
//! batch rather than leaking until it has spent the budget, and the next
//! attempt gets a quiet machine. Nothing else in the library had to learn
//! about deadlines for this to work.
//!
