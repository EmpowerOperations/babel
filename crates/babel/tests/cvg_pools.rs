//! Constraint-solving pool cases, ported from `Z3SolvingPoolFixture.kt`.
//!
//! The JVM harness asserts a *property*, not a value: ask for ten points, get
//! ten, and every one satisfies every constraint. That is strategy-agnostic, so
//! the same cases run against whatever the pool is currently made of and
//! red-versus-green tracks *capability* rather than feature-completeness.
//!
//! Which is why these split by constraint shape:
//!
//! * **Inequalities are samplable.** `20 > 2^x5` admits about 43% of its range,
//!   so rejection sampling finds points immediately.
//! * **Equality-with-tolerance is not.** `x1 == sqrt(x2) +/- 0.0001` is a
//!   measure-zero ribbon that uniform sampling will essentially never land on.
//!   Those stay red until a solver is wired up — that is the honest picture, not
//!   a gap in the port.
//!
//! All sixteen cases from the fixture are here. Several of them exercise babel
//! features — `ln`, `%`, `sgn`, `var[i]` — that nothing else puts through a
//! pool, which is worth more than the solver coverage they were written for.
//!
//! Deliberately not ported: `Z3Fixture` and `Z3ExtensionsFixture` test the Z3
//! API we are not using; `LanguageFixture` is half JVM sanity checks and half
//! decimal-to-rational conversion that belongs with the SMT emitter;
//! `IntegrationTests` asserts a list equals an integer and calls `.all()`
//! without a terminal assertion, so it either always fails or asserts nothing.
